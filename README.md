In this small project I combined different technology usage examples. This web application doesn't have any concret purpose exept demonstrationg the usage of different technologies. Here is the list of technologies used:

Back end - express, postgraphile, sequelize, sequelize cli, postgres, graphql
Front end - nextjs, react, graphql (apollo), typesctipt, jwt

In this project next js provides both client side and serverside rendering. So for simple usecases it's possible to avoid using express or any other back and library. For this cases Vercel is the easiest choice to deploy your app to there servers without any config.
